# Linear-Algebra
Studying linear algebra as a first step to upskilling at Machine Learning and Data Science. 

## Why?
Not really sure why I started studying it again but I do know that foundations are key and sometimes just revisiting some old concepts might just be whats needed to move forward.  

## Resources: 
1. [Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra lecture series](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/resources/lecture-videos/) (I am trying to studying through the lecture series on ocw.mit.edu because Youtube can get very distracting)
2. Book: [Introduction to Linear Algebra - Fourth Edition by Gilbert Strang](https://students.aiu.edu/submissions/profiles/resources/onlineBook/Y5B7M4_Introduction_to_Linear_Algebra-_Fourth_Edition.pdf)
3. ChatGPT for code and debugging.

### Godspeed.
