# # Chapter 1: Introduction to Vectors
# 

# The heart of linear algebra lies in two operations:
# 1. Sum
# 2. Product
# 
# Let there be two vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$
# 
# We can add them:
#  $\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}$
# 
# Let there be two constants $c$ and $d$<br> 
# We can multiply each vector by each constant to get: $c\mathbf{x} $ and $d\mathbf{y}$<br>
# A linear combination is the combination of the two operations: $c\mathbf{x} + d\mathbf{y}$
#
